### What to contribute 
There are two parts to ui-editor

1.	Ui-editor project – this is what gets built when you do npm start. This is made of component explorer, code editor, events editor and renderer. 

       a.	The ui needs more polishing, you can work on that if you know css
       b.	There is no good documentation written about the tool, you can write about 

           i.	how to use the tool, 

          ii.	why the tool is good,

          iii.	what makes this tool great, 

          iv.	whats the internals of the tool

          v.	how does the tool work

       c.	the user experience is very harsh right now, you can improve it, like adding auto fill to code editor, correcting font size.

2.	Ui-editor demo components – this is what gets created using the tool and gets saved in the localstorage. These are the components that are built using the tool and helps to demo how great it is to compose and build the components. Remember to run copy(components) and paste the content in editorData.js file before publishing the changes. 

3.	Ui-editor demo components – build a ui – prototyping tool within the components!. If you face hurdle – reach out to me or open an issue. If you want to improve the way you build the components – open a PR. Lets discuss.

### Why to contribute –


•	I have been working on this project because some problems in the front end community needs to be addressed. Just ranting about a problem isn’t enough so I took a step to see what I can, and it turned out just fine. I have spent enough time to architect a solution on top of which we can build plethora of tools to save time of a front end developer. If have things to complain about web development – lets talk about a software solution.

•	Root problem of front end is UX designers. This project aims to automate the workflow of web development behind an interface. This is not a threat to skills of people. This is a community effort to save time for developers. UX is just rectangle box on top of another box that gets animated visibility. I think we can build tool around it.

•	The tool can generate code and most importantly a readable code. 

•	The tool currently targets the DOM api. When the usage of the tool seems smooth, we can automate other stuffs.

•	Front end is eating lot of our personal and work time, if we work smart, we can find more time to learn other stuffs that is happening in the computer world. Life is short and I don’t want to miss out fun of playing with computer parts neither would you. Lets solve the web development problem and tackle other debts that must have been cleared.

•	Be proud to say we took an effort to clean the web development. Because many gave an excuse not to.

•	Remember the interviews you attended and felt something isn’t making any sense. You are right. Interviews or jobs do not make sense. Channel your anger towards pushing the tool forward.
